## About ANKA-UAVCS

**ANKA-UAVCS (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Control System)** is a web-based command, monitoring, and analysis platform designed to integrate **real-time drone data**, **AI-powered image recognition**, and **3D geographic visualization** into a single interface.

Developed with **Python Flask** and **JavaScript**, ANKA-UAVCS enables operators to view live camera feeds, sensor outputs, and position data while dynamically mapping and analyzing risk zones using trained AI models such as **YOLOv8**.

The platform leverages **ArcGIS** and **Leaflet.js** for advanced 3D and spatial mapping, visualizing both terrain and structural data with layered precision. It combines elements of flight control, data science, and geospatial intelligence, creating a modular architecture suitable for both research and field applications.

The project aims to demonstrate how **AI and GIS** can enhance situational awareness, decision-making, and safety in UAV operations.

## Installation and Usage

To set up ANKA-UAVCS locally, ensure that **Python 3.9+** is installed.

1. **Upgrade pip** and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

3. **Access the web interface** at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

> **Note:** Depending on your environment, external API keys (e.g., ArcGIS) may need to be configured in the `.env` file.
